flex : 1, takes all the available space
flexDirection: "column" or "row" by default "column" which is elements are aligned vertically
justifyContent:"center" => To manage the space between the elements vertically if flexDirection is "column" else horizontally
alignItems:"center" => Acts opposite to the justifyContent which is again depends on the flexDirection. used to manage space b/w elements
